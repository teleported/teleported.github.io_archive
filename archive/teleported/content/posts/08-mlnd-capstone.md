As part of Udacity Machine Learning Nanaodgree program, I did my capstone in reinforcement learning. I conceptualized, designed and executed the project.

I simulated an environment in V-REP framework wherein I setup a robotic arm tasked with picking up an object and putting it in a bin. I trained it to learn the same using Q-Learning technique.

The repository with project report and source code is [here](https://github.com/anandsaha/rl.capstone). You can see it training here in this video:
