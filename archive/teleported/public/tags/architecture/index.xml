      <title>The Cyclical Learning Rate technique</title>

      <description>Introduction Learning rate (LR) is one of the most important hyperparameters to be tuned and holds key to faster and effective training of neural networks. Simply put, LR decides how much of the loss gradient is to be applied to our current weights to move them in the direction of lower loss.
 new_weight = existing_weight - learning_rate * gradient 
The step is simple. But as research has shown, there is so much that can be done to improve this step alone which has a profound influence on the training.</description>

      <description>Introduction Fast.ai&amp;rsquo;s 2017 batch kicked off on 30th Oct and Jeremy Howard introduced us participants to the ResNet model in the first lecture itself. I had used this model earlier in the passing but got curious to dig into its architecture this time. (In fact in one of my earlier client projects I had used Faster RCNN, which uses a ResNet variant under the hood.)
ResNet was unleashed in 2015 by Kaiming He.</description>

      <title>Network In Network architecture: The beginning of Inception</title>

      <description>Introduction In this post, I explain the Network In Network paper by Min Lin, Qiang Chen, Shuicheng Yan (2013). This paper was quite influential in that it had a new take on convolutional filter design, which inspired the Inception line of deep architectures from Google.
Motivation Anyone getting introduced to convolutional networks first come across this familiar arrangement of neurons designed by Yann LeCun decades ago:
